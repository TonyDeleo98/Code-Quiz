# Code-Quiz Module 4

### Description 
This module introduces the developer to create questions for code quiz using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Creating questions and a timer for everything related to things we use for making the quiz. Created a timer using event listener for the user to have a time limit to answer questions and to make sure the limit is set to a fixed timer. Also added a high score so people who use the quiz can check there score and it can be seen through the high scores page. Looking at dev tools in the html can tell you how many times you went on the page and the local storage saves it for you.
